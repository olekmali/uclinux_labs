<h2>Prepare for the lab - direct questions</h2>

<p>Answer these questions while doing this lab &ndash; they will help you understand the procedure and better prepare for the tests.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Look around and find on your hard drive the header files for the include files &lt;linux/xxxx.h&gt; Hint: look for a directory under <span class="s_command">/usr/</span></li>
    <li>Look into <span class="s_command">man rtc</span> and explain if ioctl RTC_RD_TIME command and read from "file" do the same thing. If not, then what does read return?</li>
    <li>Check the real time clock device file name both on your Ubuntu Linux and on ucLinux. Hint: <span class="s_command">ls -l /dev/rt*</span> . Pay attention to capital o and to zero.</li>
    <li>What is the difference between <span class="s_command">open</span> and <span class="s_command">fopen</span>? </li>
    <li>What does <span class="s_command">ioctl</span> do?</li>
    <li>What does <span class="s_command">lsusb</span> do?</li>
    <li>What is <span class="s_command">UDEV</span>?
        What is <span class="s_command">EUDEV</span>? 
        What does <span class="s_command">udevadm</span> command do? 
        Why a tool like this became necessary?
    </li>
    <li>What is the file <span class="s_command">/etc/group</span>? What groups do you see predefined inside?</li>
    <li>Observe the group ownership of devices like <span class="s_command">/dev/ttyS*</span>, <span class="s_command">/dev/ttyUSB*</span>,
        <span class="s_command">/dev/input/</span>, <span class="s_command">/dev/video*</span>, <span class="s_command"> /dev/audio*</span>,
        <span class="s_command">/dev/rtc</span>, and others. 
        What groups do you see? Which devices are accessible only by root? 
        (Make a note of your findings for the sake of possible question at the exam.)
    </li>
    <li>Optional experiments: If you have access to the needed resources observe:
        <ul>
            <li>What happens when you connect more than one USB-based mouse to the system? (Touchpad might count as the first mouse.) Watch for <span class="s_command">/dev/mouse*</span> and <span class="s_command">/dev/mice</span> </li>
            <li>What happens when you connect more than one USB-to-serial converter?</li>

    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Prepare for the lab - indirect questions</h2>

<ul>
    <li>A set of questions about partition tables and partitions:
        <ul>
            <li>What is the maximum number of partition tables that can be located on one disk?</li>
            <li>What is the maximum number of partition entries that are stored directly in one partition table?</li>
            <li>Disregard practical limitations of disk capacity and data processing time, what is the maximum number of partitions on one disk?</li>
            <li>Are there any emerging standards (not yet fully adopted) that can cause that there are two sets of correct answers to this group of questions?</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Windows &quot;format d: /s&quot; or Linux mkfs -t ext2&quot; - are they perform high level disk formatting, or low level disk formatting?</li>
    <li>Consider: GRUB, LILO, SYSLINUX, NTLDR: which ones can load only an operating system 
        which ones can load only another boot loader, which ones can do both?
    </li>
    <li>Is legacy floppy disk boot record a master or volume boot record?</li>
    <li>What is the maximum file name or path name in number of characters on the following file systems: FAT-12, FAT-32, NTFS, ext2,3,4?</li>

<h2>Activity 1 (10 pts.)</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Find and inspect the Linux rtc device. Run <span class="s_command">ls -l /dev/rt*</span></li>
    <li class="s_tograde">Capture the screen that shows who can access the device and to what capacity.</li>
    <li>Change the access restrictions and add another alias for the <span class="s_command">rtc</span> device:
        <ol>
            <li>Run <span class="s_command">udevadm info -a -p /sys/class/rtc/rtc0</span> and observe its output</li>
            <li>Edit/create the content of the file <span class="s_command">/etc/udev/rules.d/10-local.rules</span> and add the following line:
                <br><span class="s_command">SUBSYSTEM==&quot;rtc&quot; KERNEL==&quot;rtc0&quot; SYMLINK=&quot;clock&quot; MODE=&quot;0666&quot; GROUP=&quot;uclinux&quot;</span></li>
            <li>Run <span class="s_command">sudo udevadm control --reload-rules</span></li>
            <li>Run <span class="s_command">sudo udevadm trigger</span></li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Run <span class="s_command">ls -l /dev/rt* /dev/cl*</span></li>
    <li class="s_tograde">Capture the view of the output of the <span class="s_command">ls</span> command above.</li>
    <li>Refer to the example program that illustrates use of direct read and 
        write as well as ioctl in order to access features of the RTC device. 
        Write a short program that accesses <span class="s_command">/dev/rtc<span class="s_cmd_choice">x</span></span> 
        or its equivalent and prints the current time of the hardware clock.
        <ol>
            <li>Use <a href="A_rtc_outline.c.HTML">the following loose program outline</a>. 
                Please note that we will read the clock state not by reading from the device file 
                (like we did in case of joystick) but instead by executing ioctl with parameter 
                <span class="s_command">RTC_RD_TIME</span> and the pointer to a variable of type 
                <span class="s_command">rtc_time</span>.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>

<h3>Details for BeagleBone</h3>

<p>The LEDs on the BBB are on GPIO numbers 21, 22, 23, and 24.
That corresponds to GPIO addresses of 53, 54, 55, and 56 (gpio+32), 
OR 533, 534, 535, and 536 (gpio+512)
depending on the addressing convention used by your Linux OS.
Note that GPIO numbers do not correspond to the pin numbers on the board connectors.</p>

<p>The S2/boot button is on GPIO number 40 which is either 72 or 552. 
(Pressed value is 0, released value is 1.)</p>

<p>The design of the recent operating systems including 2024 Buildroot for Beaglebone 
disabled direct access to these LEDs using low-level GPIO. 
Instead, you have to use the predefined devices located at <span class="s_command">/sys/class/leds/</span>.</p>

<p>However, first, disable the predefined actions on these four LEDs (until the next system reboot)
by running four commands in the format like the one listed below. Adjust file names as necessary.
<br><span class="s_command">echo none &gt; /sys/class/leds/beaglebone\:green\:usrN/trigger
</p>


<h3>Details for RaspberryPi</h3>

<p>The GREEN LED is on GPIO 47 and the RED LED is on GPIO 35. The USB high power mode LED is on GPI38.</p>

<p>The design of Raspberry Pi 3 or later disabled direct access to these LEDs using low-level GPIO. 
Instead, you have to use the predefined devices located at <span class="s_command">/sys/class/leds/</span>.</p>

<p>However, first, disable the predefined actions on the two LEDs (until the next system reboot):
<br><span class="s_command">echo none &gt; /sys/class/leds/led0/trigger
<br>echo none &gt;/sys/class/leds/led1/trigger</span></p>



<h3>Details for Orange Pi Zero 3</h3>

<p>The GREEN LED is on GPIO 77 and the RED LED is on GPIO 76.</p>

<p>The design of Orange Pi Zero 3 Buildroot disabled direct access to these LEDs using low-level GPIO. 
Instead, you have to use the predefined devices located at <span class="s_command">/sys/class/leds/</span>.</p>

<p>However, first, disable the predefined actions on the two LEDs (until the next system reboot):
<br><span class="s_command">echo none &gt; /sys/class/leds/green_led/trigger
<br>echo none &gt;/sys/class/leds/red_led/trigger</span>
</p>



<h2>Submission</h2>

<p>Submit both the source code of your program or script and
a short video demonstration of the LED control to the corresponding assignment drop box on Canvas.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>



<h2>Criteria for Success</h2>

<p>Successful completion of Activity 1 relies on three steps that can be evaluated independently. 
<ul>
    <li>25% of credit is awarded for successful demonstration that RTC is replicated to CLOCK.</li>
    <li>Next 25% of credit is subsequently awarded for successful demonstration that CLOCK 
        can be accessed without escalating privileges to root.</li>
    <li>Another 50%  of credit is awarded for successful demonstration of executing an expanded
        version of the provided RTC program. In case the aforementioned steps are not
        successful, the program can be executed using sudo in the privileged mode and access RTC device
        instead of CLOCK device alias.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Successful completion of Activity 2 is evaluated based on the content of 
the provided (submitted) shell script or source code of a program in C or C++, 
and the video recording of the behavior of of that program to control the board LEDs. 
A complete demo documents starting the program from a console and then focuses on the board LEDs, 
all recorded in one uninterrupted session.</p>
