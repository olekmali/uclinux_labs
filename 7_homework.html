<ul>
</ul>


<h2>🔍 Prepare for the lab</h2>

<p>Answer these questions while doing this lab &ndash; they will help you understand cross-compiling and program transfer procedure. 
Even though this lab may not seem as much work please do study the utilities in question in order to be prepared for the exam.</p>

<ul>
    <li>What is the difference between a regular compiler on your system 
        and a cross-compiler for the plain BeagleBone, Raspberry Pi, or Orange Pi executable, 
        and the cross-compiler that you just set up to use?
        <ul>
            <li>What are their names on your system? (Provide the gcc cross-compiler file name specific to your Buildroot Linux setup if asked at the exam.) </li>
            <li>Where are these tools located? (Provide folder name specific to your Linux setup if asked at the exam.) </li>
            <li>What other tools are available in the cross-compiler folder? (Just peek at the folder, you probably will not be asked this question at the exam.) </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>What is the role of <span class="s_command">.bashrc</span> in bash shell?
        <ul>
            <li>What is the name and location of the global shell configuration file equivalent to <span class="s_command">.bashrc</span>?</li>
            <li>What is the use of <span class="s_command">PATH </span>environment variable?</li>
            <li>What is <span class="s_command">/etc/environment</span> configuration file, if present on your system?</li>
            <li>What is <span class="s_command">umask</span>?</li>
        </ul>
     </li>
    <li>What are <span class="s_command">ifconfig</span>, <span class="s_command">ifdown</span>, and <span class="s_command">ifup</span>? </li>
    <li>What are the differences between <span class="s_command">HyperTerm</span>/<span class="s_command">putty</span>/<span class="s_command">minicom</span> (1),<span class="s_command"> telnet</span> (2), <span class="s_command">ssh</span> (3), and <span class="s_command">rlogin</span> (4)?</li>
    <li>What are the differences between 
        <span class="s_command">ftp</span> (1), 
        <span class="s_command">sftp</span> (2), 
        <span class="s_command">scp</span> (3), and 
        <span class="s_command">rsync</span> (4)?
    </li>
    <li>What is the difference between <span class="s_command">ssh</span> (1) and <span class="s_command">sftp</span> (2)?</li>
    <li>Why it was important to assign a password to account that we want to access remotely over the network?</li>
    <li>In case of problems with transferring the file using network 
        the file can be placed directly on the SD card as the last resort solution. 
        Why typically it needs to be done as a root even if the file is to be placed in a regular user folder? 
        (Think file ownership!)
    </li>
    <li>Why is it possible to access the embedded system through its serial port? 
        Hint: check <span class="s_command">/etc/inittab</span> for <span class="s_command">getty</span>, and <span class="s_command">/etc/securetty</span>.
    </li>
    <li>What is the purpose of the file <span class="s_command">/etc/fstab</span>?</li>
    <li>What is the meaning of each column of the file <span class="s_command">/etc/fstab</span>? 
        What is the meaning of the last two columns with numbers?</li>
    <li>In file <span class="s_command">/etc/passwd</span> each user is assigned one number. What is the use of that number in the Linux system? </li>
    <li>In file <span class="s_command">/etc/group</span> each group has zero to several users listed at the end of the line. What does that mean?</li>
    <li>What is the significance of the <span class="s_command">/home</span> directory?</li>
    <li>Where is the root account home directory located?</li>
</ul>


<h2>🖥️ Activity 1 (20 pts.)</h2>

<h3>Cross-compiling and data transfer among Linux systems</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Write a simple "Hello World" program that prints to the standard 
        output text <span class="s_command">"\nHello, World, my name is <span class="s_cmd_choice">your name</span>\n\n"</span>.
        <ul>
            <li><span class="s_command">gedit prog7.c &amp;</span></li>
        </ul>    
    </li>
    <li>Test the program by compiling and running on the local machine (i.e. inside the virtual machine.)
        <ul>
            <li><span class="s_command">gcc prog7.c -o prog7pc.exe</span></li>
            <li><span class="s_command">./prog7pc.exe</span></li>
        </ul>    
    </li>
    <li>Identify the location of the cross-compiler as demonstrated in class
        <br>Hint: check contents of the directory
        <span class="s_command"><span class="s_cmd_choice">buildroot-dddddddd-ppp/</span>output/host/usr/bin/</span>
    </li>
    <li>Consider adding the full path to the compiler to your path in your account <span class="s_command">.bashrc</span> (optional)</li>
    <li>Cross-compile the program as demonstrated in class.
        <ul>
            <li><span class="s_command">/home/<span class="s_cmd_choice">userid/lab7_dir/your_buildroot_dir/</span>output/host/usr/bin/<span class="s_cmd_choice">crosscompiler_prefix-</span>gcc prog7.c -o prog7uc.exe</span></li>
        </ul>    
    </li>
    <li>Connect to your Microcontroller Linux running on the board using UART or SSH. 
        Check if the board has access to the Internet (optional) and the board IP address.
        <ul>
            <li><span class="s_command">ping google.com</span></li>
            <li><span class="s_command">ifconfig</span></li>
            <li><span class="s_command">ip addr</span></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Transfer the compiled binary file to the microcontroller running Buildroot and test if it runs.
        At this point you can test it by running from the root account.
        <ul>
            <li><span class="s_command">scp <span class="s_cmd_choice">crosscompiled_program</span> 
                root@<span class="s_cmd_choice">microcontroller_ip_address</span>:</span></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Attempt to run the program as root to verify if it can be executed</li>
    <li>If you accomplish this much and properly document it
        (e.g. by executing <span class="s_command">uname -a</span> and then your program), 
        it would count as 50% towards the lab credit.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Place user home directory on a separate partition in the Buildroot system</h3>

<ul>
    <li>If you have not done so in Lab 6, add the extra partition to the SD card and format it to ext4.
        <ul>
            <li>Do it form your Linux system. It is not viable to do it from inside Buildroot
                as we did not include required commands when configuring menuconfig in lab 6.</li>
            <li>Lookup in Lab 6 how the partition labeled <span class="s_command">DATA</span> 
                is added using <span class="s_command">fdisk</span>
                and later formatted using <span class="s_command">mkfs</span>
            </li>
            <li>Note: Depending on your board that extra partition ie either the third or the second partition.</li>
            <li>If you are lost while using command line tools, use <code<span class="s_command">gparted</span> and do it using GUI interface.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Run your Buildroot Microcontroller Linux on the microcontroller. Login as <span class="s_command">root</span>.
        Set up the third partition to mount automatically as the home directory for users.
        <ul>
            <li>Check if the directory <span class="s_command">/home</span> exists.
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="s_command">ls -l /</span></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>If there is no <span class="s_command">/home</span> do the following:
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="s_command">mkdir /home/</span></li>
                    <li><span class="s_command">chmod u=rwx,go=rx /home</span></li>
                    <li><span class="s_command">ls -l /</span></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>look for the names of SD card partitions the way they are visible from the uC Linux.
                <ul>
                    <li>They may not look like <span class="s_command">/dev/sd<span class="s_cmd_choice">x</span></span></li>
                    <li>They may look like <span class="s_command">/dev/mmcblk<span class="s_cmd_choice">x</span>p<span class="s_cmd_choice">y</span></span></li>
                    <li>In BeagleBone you can see one or two disks, the second one of them will have three partitions.</li>
                    <li>You should see one disk with three partitions. 
                        Use the next available (typically the third) partition of that disk.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Edit <span class="s_command">/etc/fstab/</span> using your favorite editor on Microcontroller Linux.
                <ul>
                    <li>Add a line to fstab that looks like the line that defines the mount point for <span class="s_command">/</span> .
                        The columns shall show:
                        <ul>
                            <li>1) it uses the partition identified in the previous step above 
                                <span class="s_command">/dev/mmcblk<span class="s_cmd_choice">x</span>p<span class="s_cmd_choice">y</span></span> 
                                as the source.
                            </li>
                            <li>2) it uses <span class="s_command">/home/</span> as the destination</li>
                            <li>3) the file system type is ext4.
                                <br>ext4 is a journaling file system that may cause more wearing off of the SD card 
                                but it is also more reliable in case of unexpected power failure.
                            </li>
                            <li>4) make it read-write in case the original partition is read-only.</li>
                            <li>5) 6) the last two parameters (numbers) are 0 and 2,<br>Lookup the meaning of those numbers.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Save the file. sync, reboot, and login again.</li>
            <li>Check if the <span class="s_command">/home</span> directory exists and is mapped to the partition:
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="s_command">mount</span></li>
                    <li><span class="s_command">ls -lF /</span></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>If outcome of the commands does not match the results shown in the class demonstration, 
                correct the problem before advancing to the next step.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Add a user account to the Buildroot system</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Add a new user that has a user name related to your name, preferably your BUnetID.
        <ul>
            <li>Create a new user called <span class="s_cmd_choice">BUnetID</span> 
                and a new group called <span class="s_command">users</span>. 
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="s_command">adduser -G users <span class="s_cmd_choice">BUnetID</span></</span></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Check if user and group exist. The relevant entry should have been appended at the very end of each file.
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="s_command">cat /etc/passwd</span></li>
                    <li><span class="s_command">cat /etc/group</span></li>
                    <li><span class="s_command">cat /etc/shadow</span></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Otherwise, correct the problem. There is no point to continue without the user being added.</li>
            <li>Check if the directory for the user has been created and has correct ownership and access properties
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="s_command">ls -l /home</span></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Otherwise, you can create the directory manually. You are root so sudo is not necessary.
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="s_command">mkdir -p /home/<span class="s_cmd_choice">BUnetID</span></span></li>
                    <li><span class="s_command">chown -R <span class="s_cmd_choice">BUnetID</span>:users /home/<span class="s_cmd_choice">BUnetID</span></span></li>
                    <li><span class="s_command">chmod u=rwx,go=rx /home/<span class="s_cmd_choice">BUnetID</span></span></li>
                    <li><span class="s_command">ls -l /home</span></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>If you do not remember user's password you can always reset it as root:
        <ul>
            <li><span class="s_command">passwd <span class="s_cmd_choice">BUnetID</span></</span></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>You do not have to reboot, the new user is active immediately</li>
</ul>


<h2>📤 Submission</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Copy your cross-compiled program again from the Linux machine but this time to the user's account.
        <ul>
            <li><span class="s_command">scp <span class="s_cmd_choice">crosscompiled_program</span>

<p>Thank you.</p>



<h2>🎯 Criteria for Success</h2>

<p>The success in this lab is measured by the following outcomes:
<ul>
    <li>Creating the third partition in the Buildroot system and mounting it as <span class="s_command">/home</span> directory (25%)</li>
    <li>Creating a new user account in the Buildroot system and successfully signing in into it (25%)</li>
    <li>Corss-compiling a short program in C or C++, and validating the process by executing it in the Buildroot system (50%)</li>
    <li>Each of the steps above is validated by successful screen capture of the requested commands.
        Work can be graded correctly only if the screen capture contains all necessary information.
        So make sure that <span class="s_command">PuTTY</span> (or equivalnt) terminal is resized so that the requested activity is captured.</li>
</ul>
