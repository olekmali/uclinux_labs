<h2>Prepare for the lab</h2>

<p>Answer these questions while doing this lab &ndash; they will help you understand the procedure and better prepare for the tests.</p>
<ul>
    <li>What is<span class="s_command"> Makefile </span>and what is its basic structure?</li>
    <li>What are the dependencies?</li>
    <li>What are the rules?</li>
    <li>Why preserving tabs (<span class="s_command">'\t'</span>) and not allowing them to be converted to spaces (<span class="s_command">' '</span>) in the <span class="s_command">Makefile</span> is important?</li>
    <li>What does <em class="s_command">Draw Spaces</em> do when activated in <span class="s_command">gedit</span>? Why it may be useful when editing makefiles?</li>
    <li>Does the file controlling the behavior of <span class="s_command">make</span> command need to to be named <span class="s_command">Makefile</span> with capitalized first character? Why so, or why not?</li>
    <li>What are the differences between a compiler and a linker?</li>
    <li>What does <span class="s_command">ar</span> program do, what are its input file(s), and how its result file is used later?</li>
    <li>What are the differences between a static library and a shared library?</li>
    <li>What are the linker options -L and -l? Why -L option is needed in our project?</li>
    <li>How are<span class="s_command"> Makefile </span>variables declared and used? Why it is convenient to use them?</li>
    <li>What does<span class="s_command"> ufw </span>program do? How to set it up, 
    enable, and manage basic configuration of its settings?</li>
</ul>


<h2>Activity (20 pts.)</h2>

<h3>Creating static libraries and introduction to Makefile</h3>
<p>Download and unpack the <a href="4_code.tar.gz">code.tar.gz</a> 
project. Learn how to unpack it using console window utilities rather 
than graphical tools. Modify the existing <span class="s_command">Makefile</span> so that it support 
four projects - building <span class="s_command">tnplib</span> static library and then three programs. You can start with the partialy completed <span class="s_command">Makefile</span> . The third project is 
<a href="4_http_multi.cpp.HTML" class="s_command">http_multi.cpp</a>. Compile and run all 
programs. Use a Web browser to verify whether they work and what they 
do. Be prepared to 
answer all questions regarding unpacking and packing the project, and the structure of Makefiles.</p>
<p>Suggested procedure:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Install (if you have not done it earleir) and configure the firewall:<br><span class="s_command">
    sudo apt install ufw<br>sudo ufw allow 22/tcp<br>sudo ufw allow 8081/tcp<br>
    sudo ufw allow 8082/tcp<br>sudo ufw allow 8083/tcp<br>sudo ufw enable<br>
    sudo ufw status</span></li>
    <li>Prepare the gedit text editor to be more useful when editing makefiles:
    <ul>
        <li><span class="s_command">sudo apt-get install gedit-plugins</span></li>
        <li>Run gedit and enable the plugin called <em class="s_command">Draw Spaces</em>. See: MENU/Edit/Preferences/Plugins tab</li>
        <li>You can disable and re-enable it at any time. If you cannot get used to the new view of your text files, please enable it at least once for a short time when editing the <span class="s_command">Makefile</span></li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Using a Web browser save the <a href="4_code.tar.gz">code.tar.gz</a> project into a folder where you want to do your work</li>
    <li>open a console window and go to the folder where you saved the file</li>
    <li>unpack it</li>
    <li>find the name of the folder that was created, and go to the folder</li>
    <li>edit file named http_multi.cpp (create it) and paste contents of <a href="4_http_multi.cpp.HTML" class="s_command">http_multi.cpp</a></li>
    <li>edit Makefile</li>
    <li>modify the Makefile to include the third target project (create appropriate rule entires and modify the rule for <em>all</em>)</li>
    <li>run make all</li>
    <li>start on of the compiled programs</li>
    <li>Verify if the programs do work an d what they do using a Web browser. Location is <span class="s_command"><a href="http://localhost:8081/">
    http://localhost:<span>PORT</span>/</a></span> <br>
    where PORT is the port number for a program (e.g. 8081, or 8082, or 8083)</li>
    <li>create a rule entry for creating the <span class="s_command">libtnplib.a</span> that depends on <span class="s_command">tnplib.o</span> <br>
    Note: in order to create a library one needs to run:
    <ul>
        <li class="s_command">ar -rcs libtnplib.a tnplib.o</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>In other rules replace dependence from <span class="s_command">tnplib.o</span> to <span class="s_command">libtnplib.a</span></li>
    <li>The linker now should not use <span class="s_command">tnplib.o</span> but instead the static library <span class="s_command">-L. -ltnplib</span> 
    <br>and <strong>place it after</strong> any other *.o files because of 
    possible command line argument interpretation error inside g++</li>
    <li>Modify the options for <span class="s_command">ARFLAGS</span> as necessary close to the top of the file 
    if necessary</li>
    <li>Modify rule clean to remove the compiled library as well</li>
    <li>run <span class="s_command">make all</span> and inspect the folder</li>
    <li>run <span class="s_command">make clean</span> and inspect the folder</li>
    <li>run <span class="s_command">make tar</span> to prepare the file for submission</li>
    <li>rename the file <span class="s_command">whatever.tar.gz</span> to
    <span class="s_command">whatever.tgz</span> so that it is accepted by the 
    submission system</li>
</ul>



<h2>Submission</h2>

<p>Drop off the compressed (tar-gzipped) contents of your project folder in the corresponding assignment drop box on Canvas.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>



<h2>Criteria for Success</h2>

<p>The success in this lab is measured by the following outcomes:
<ul>
    <li>Adding the third compilation target to the provided Makelfile.
        I.e. make all will compile all three programs instead of the two 
        that are compiled by the provided Makefile out-of-the-box. (50%)</li>
    <li>Creating a custom library file that contains tnplib.o (25%)</li>
    <li>Linking all software targets with the created custom library 
        libtnplib.a (-l and -L options) instead of with tnplib.o object. (25%)</li>
    <li>Successfull packing all related files using tar and utiilizing 
        one of the available compression methods. (minor penalty if not done.)</li>
    <li>Grading is implemented by Makefile inspection and possibly
        by verification by running the <span class="s_command">make</span> command with various targets.</li>
    <li>Additional modest extra credit of up to 10% is awarded if the fully successful lab 
        is submitted early ahead of the deadline as defined when majority of course participants 
        start submitting successfully completed lab assignments.</li>
</ul>
