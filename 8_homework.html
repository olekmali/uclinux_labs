<h2>Activity 1 (10 pts.)</h2>

<h3>Preparing and installing services on Linux and ucLinux operating systems</h3>

<p>Consider vthe provided program</a> 
that could run as a Web server on port 88 and a 
<a href="8_http-counter.sh.HTML">startup script</a> 
that can be used to configure it as a service. 
They are provided in the provided <a href="8_code.tar.gz">archive file</a> along with the needed 
source code of the library supporting it.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Download the <a href="8_code.tar.gz">8_code.tar.gz</a> archive and unpack its contents</li>
    <li><strong><span class="s_tograde">Record this test using script for the assignment submission.</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong><span class="s_cmd_4grade">script hw8_1.txt</span></strong></span></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Compile <a href="8_http-counter.cpp.HTML">http-counter.cpp</a> for execution on Ubuntu. 
        Let the executable file be named <span class="s_command">http-counter</span>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="s_command">g++ http-counter.cpp tnplib.cpp -o http-counter</span></li>
            <li><span class="s_tosee">If you downloaded and unpacked the provided archive you can expect 
                that the program compiles out of the box and the binary file http-counter is created.</span></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li> The program needs a folder to save its data files. Look up its name in the source code and amend the command below as needed.
        <ul>
            <li><span class="s_command">mkdir -p /var/log/http-counter</span></li>
            <li><span class="s_tosee">You can expect that the directory is not created because only root 
                can manipulate files and directories in this location. You can verify that using ls -l command.</span></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li> Try to run the program as not root and observe failure of the server socket binding to a port below 1024 limit and then again as a root.
        <ul>
            <li><span class="s_command">./http-counter</span></li>
            <li><span class="s_command">sudo ./http-counter</span></li>
            <li><span class="s_tosee">You can expect that the program files because it cannot change to user counter,
                or also becasue it cannot open a sockat at port below 1024 as it does not run as root.</span></li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>It is a bad idea to let run services as root, especially those that are exposed to the outside network. 
        In case a service is compromised a third party could gain the same privileges as the user that runs the service. 
        Therefore, the typical set up involves securing a service by switching it to a non-root, non-administrative user. 
        Typically this can done by the service software that could set up all necessary connections 
        and then change the user ID and group ID of a process. 
        This server already contains such code and is designed to fail if the user cannot be changed.
        Let us add that account now. In addition, we need create log file directory and adjust its ownership.
        <ul>
            <li><span class="s_command">sudo adduser counter --group --system --disabled-password --no-create-home 
                --home /var/log/http-counter --shell /bin/sh</span>
            </li>
            <li><span class="s_command">sudo mkdir -p /var/log/http-counter</span></li>
            <li><span class="s_tosee">You can expect that the directory is created. 
                You can verify that using ls -l command.</span></li>
            <li><span class="s_command">sudo chown -R counter:counter /var/log/http-counter</span></li>
            <li><span class="s_tosee">You can expect that the directory is now owned by the counter user.  
                You can verify that using ls -l command.</span></li>
            <li><span class="s_command">sudo chmod a+rx,u+w /var/log/http-counter</span></li>
            <li><span class="s_tosee">You can expect that the directory is accessible to all and user counter can write to it. 
                You can verify that using ls -l command.</span></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Analyze how we are testing the program by running commands below. 
        <ul>
            <li><span class="s_command">ls -l</span></li>
            <li><span class="s_command">sudo ./http-counter</span>
                <br>Note: If you just run the program and it still runs, 
                so this subsequent run is expected to fail with &quot;bind failed.&quot;
            </li>
            <li><span class="s_tosee">You can expect that the server program will start correctly 
                with confirmation printed to the console and releases the console.</span></li>
            <li><span class="s_command">wget http://localhost:88/ -O -</span>
                <br>Note: -O is capital O letter, not lowercase o or zero!
            </li>
            <li><span class="s_tosee">You can expect that the source code of a web page is printed to the console.</span></li>
            <li><span class="s_command">wget http://localhost:88/ -O -</span></li>
            <li><span class="s_command">wget http://localhost:88/ -O - </span></li>
            <li><span class="s_tosee">You can expect that the number embedded in the webpage increases</span></li>
            <li><span class="s_tosee">Testing from a GUI web browser is optional.</span></li>
            <li><span class="s_command">ls -l</span></li>
            <li><span class="s_command">ls -l /var/log/http-counter</span></li>
            <li><span class="s_command">cat /var/log/http-counter/counter.txt</span>
                <br>Note: If the program was never shut down before the file shall not exist yet.
            </li>
            <li><span class="s_tosee">If this is the first time you run an operational server you can expect
                the command to fail as there is no text file.</span></li>
            <li><span class="s_command">sudo killall http-counter </span></li>
            <li><span class="s_command">wget http://localhost:88/ -O - </span></li>
            <li><span class="s_tosee">You can expect that the webpage retrieval fails becasue the server no longer runs.</span></li>                
            <li><span class="s_command">ls -l /var/log/http-counter</span></li>
            <li><span class="s_command">cat /var/log/http-counter/counter.txt</span></li>
            <li><span class="s_tosee">You can expect that the file exists and contains the number that was displayed 
                when its web page was accessed for the last time.</span></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Copy the program as root into <span class="s_command">/usr/sbin/</span>. 
        <ul>
            <li><span class="s_command">sudo cp http-counter /usr/sbin/ </span></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><span class="s_tosee">You can expect that the binary file is copied to that location.

    <li>Download the service startup script <span class="s_command"><a href="8_http-counter.sh.HTML">http-counter.sh</a></span> 
        into your account. You may alredy have it available becasue it was included the the tar file 
        that you unpacked.
        <br />Note that this is a text-based script file to start a binary file 
            that is located somewhere else and has the same name (and perhaps a different file extension.)
    </li>
    <li><span class="s_command">gedit http-counter.sh</span> and inspect against unnecessary 
        <span class="s_command">^M</span> characters at the end of each line. 
        Such artifacts may have been created by previously editing the file under Windows.
    </li>

</ul>

<h2>Activity 2 (10 pts.)</h2>

<h3>Preparing and installing services on Linux and ucLinux operating systems</h3>

<p>Consider <a href="8_code.tar.gz">the provided program</a> that could run as a Web server on port 88. </p>
<ul>
    <li>Cross-compile for execution on the microcontroller board running ucLinux 
        - use the same compiler family that you used in the previous lab.
    </li>
    <li>Copy the cross-compiled program and the startup script to the  microcontroller board running ucLinux.
        <br>Use <span class="s_command">scp</span>, direct placement on the SD card or any other technique.</li>
    <li>Start <span class="s_command">ssh</span>, perform all remaining work on ucLinux as root 
        including creating an extra user and group the same way as on Ubuntu 
        except for the service configuration. Instead do it as described below:
        <ul>
            <li>The service installation file should be renamed to 
                <span class="s_command"><a href="8_http-counter.sh.HTML">S80http-counter.sh</a></span> 
                and should be placed inside <span class="s_command">/etc/init.d</span> directory.
            </li>
            <li>The cross-compiled service binary file should be called 
                <span class="s_command">http-counter</span> and placed in <span class="s_command">/usr/sbin</span>
            </li>
            <li>Make sure that both files are owned by root and are set as executable</li>
            <li>Create the same user with disabled login and group as in case of Ubuntu</li>
            <li>There are no run levels to customize, or are there? 
                In case there are run levels, please see the run level configuration 
                for a Debian-like distributions and check if there is one for ucLinux. 
            </li>
            <li>Look at the two files in the <span class="s_command">/etc/init.d</span> directory: 
                <span class="s_command">rcS</span> and <span class="s_command">rcK</span>. 
                Those two files are responsible for starting and stopping the services.
                <strong>No changes are needed!</strong>
            </li>
            <li>Reboot the ucLinux<br><span class="s_command">sudo reboot</span></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Reconnect using <span class="s_command">ssh</span> as the connection was dropped during reboot</li>
    <li><span class="s_tograde">Record this test using script for the assignment submission.
        <ul>
            <li><strong><span class="s_cmd_4grade">script hw8_2.txt</span></strong></span></li>
        </ul>
        Alternative, if you use PuTTY (on Windows or Linux) instead of ssh, you can enable logging
        the console activity to a text file. See: session/Logging settings before connecting.
    </li>
    <li>Log in again and perform the tests below in order to verify if the service runs correctly</li>
    <li>Show the results of your work for the record in the script or resize the terminal window
        (PuTTY or ssh) and capture the activity as an image.
        (this is really the only portion of the lab that is needed for grading)

    <li><span class="s_tograde">Finish recording this test using script for the assignment submission.</span></li>
    <li>If the test above does not work inspect the installation, make corrections and redo the entire test above.</li>
    <li>Optionally test if the service is accessible from your PC by using a GUI-based Web browser on Linux or on Windows 
        <span class="s_command"><a href="http://192.168.1.xx:88/">http://<span class="s_cmd_choice">192.168.1.xx</span>:88/</a></span>.

<h2>Submission</h2>

<p>Drop each file with <span class="s_tograde">the information collected during the exercise as instructed</span> 
in the corresponding assignment drop box on Canvas.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>



<h2>Criteria for Success</h2>

<p>The success in this lab is measured by the following outcomes:
<ul>
    <li>The service binary file and service control files are placed in correct locations 
        that is veriffied by starting and stopping the service (not the program directly) manually.
        The sevice operation is tested using <span class="s_command">wget</span> command.</li>
    <li>Since the program and the control scripts are provided, there is not much else to do
        and thus to grade in this lab. So that is all-or-nothing grading scheme.</li>
    <li>Persistence of service is expected but the current lab procedure is not cunductive to be easily graded.</li>
    <li>The Buildroot portion of the lab contains cross-compilation procedure that has been already graded by Lab 7.</li>
</ul>
