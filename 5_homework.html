<ul>
    <li><span class="style1">You need <strong>about 10GB of free space</strong> before you start in order to complete the task</span>.</li>
    <li>You can reclaim the space <strong>after the assignment is graded</strong> by deleting the folder with the Kernel source code.</li>
    <li>Once make is started no constant attention is needed. Just come back after an hour or so 
        and check if the process is done or failed and needs corrections and starting over. We hope you will not have to start over!
    </li>
    <li><span class="style1">This procedure has been extensively tested on Ubuntu Linux 22.04 for kernels 6.8 for AMD64/Intel x86_64 processor. 
        Report any problems or any needed corrections to the instructor ASAP. Proceed with other platforms than Intel/AMD at your own risk 
        as they require altered instruction that may not be tested or troubleshooted by the instructor.</span></li>

    <li>Configure the kernel by copying configuration file from the host system. 
        You can either compile a generic version of the kernel that will work with 
        various types of hardware or build one that uses only modules that are 
        currently in use. In the first case you will need a lot of disk space. In 
        the latter case any significant change to hardware may result in 
        unrecognized component.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>CHOICE 1</strong> - Specialized kernel that will work only with the hardware 
                currently in use but will need only <strong>about 8 GB of free hard drive space</strong>
                to compile. It works for kernels 2.6.32- or later.&nbsp; It takes about one hour to compile.
                <ul>
                    <li>Make sure that you are running the generic version of the&nbsp;kernel</li>
                    <li>Plug in all devices that you expect to use on the system 
                        including SD card readers (with SD cards) and USB flash drives/</li>
                    <li><span class="style2">make localmodconfig</span></li>
                    <li>Give the default answers to any questions (about configuration 
                        settings not set in your current kernel built)</li>
                </ul>
        <li><strong>CHOICE 2</strong> - Universal generic kernel, 
            <strong>requires a lot (20GB or more) of disk space to compile and takes several hours of unattended compilation</strong>
            <ul>
            <li><span class="style2">uname -r</span></li>
            <li><span class="style2">ls -l /boot/config*</span></li>
            <li><span class="style2">cp /boot/config-<span class="style5">6.NN.0-MM-generic</span> ./.config</span>
                <br>Use the current (latest) name of the configuration file of the same or newer Kernel version that is in use. 
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>BACK TO THE COMMON PATH</strong></li>
        <li><span class="style2">make menuconfig</span> 
            <br>This brings up the Configuration Menu
            <ul>
                <li>You can make any configuration changes at this point. Be warned 
                    &#8211; this could damage your installation.</li>
                <li>We do not have access to the distributors security certificates. 
                    Make sure the following options are empty.
                    <ul>
                        <li>CONFIG_SYSTEM_TRUSTED_KEYS=""</li>
                        <li>CONFIG_SYSTEM_REVOCATION_KEYS=""</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Apparently there is a frequent problem with signing kernel modules
                    when ZSTD compression is enabled. You can either disable that option
                    upfront or do it later and restart the make (without running mrproper rule.)
                    <ul>
                        <li>CONFIG_MODULE_COMPRESS_NONE=y</li>
                        <li># CONFIG_MODULE_COMPRESS_ZSTD is not set</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Select Exit and Yes to save.</li>
                <li>If you had problems locating any of the options above then exit menucofig 
                    and instead edit the configuration file directly using gedit.
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="style2">gedit .config &amp;</span></li>

            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<p>You are now ready to build your custom kernel. 
However, we will make all the changes necessary to create a system call 
so that we do not have to rebuild the kernel twice.
We will create a system call named test_call, which will print &ldquo;Hello World!&rdquo; in the system log. </p>

<p>Since we are not passing a pointer [to a structure] as a parameter we can use 
the same function both for 64-bity and 32-bit versions of the kernel. Otherwise, 
we would have to create two separate functions for the same system call numbers 
and register each only in the system call table corresponding to a particular 
version of the kernel.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Create a new directory for the call
        <ul>
            <li><span class="style2">mkdir test_call</span></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Create a new file in the test_call directory.
        <ul>
            <li><span class="style2">gedit test_call/test_call.c &amp;</span></li>
            <li>Enter the following text</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<pre class="style3">/*----------Start of test_call.c----------*/<br>#include &lt;linux/kernel.h&gt;

</ul>
<pre class="style3">########## Start of Makefile ##########

<ul>
    <ul>
        <li> Save file as Makefile in the test_call directory </li>
    </ul>
    <li>Inspect the top level Makefile. In earlier kernels (before 6.x) we would register the activity above in this file
    <ul>
        <li><span class="style2">gedit Makefile &amp;</span></li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>but starting with kernel version 6.x we do it in Kbuild
    <ul>
        <li><span class="style2">gedit Kbuild &amp;</span></li>
        <li>Append the following line at the end of the file to register the new directory and its Makefile.</li>
        <li>Save the file and any other future file after you modify them.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<pre class="style3"># Registering our custom system call source directory and its local Makefile
obj-y += test_call/</pre>


<p>We are going to register our function in the big switch-case statement that 
is run each time a system call interrupt/trap is invoked. The interrupt service 
routine prepares the environment to run a system call function and then runs the 
requested function. The function number and the parameters are provided in the 
processor registers just before the interrupt/trap is generated.</p>

<p>We will limit our exercise only to AMD64 and Intel32 architectures. If you 
desire to run this lab on a RaspberryPi you would have to select the 
corresponding ARM architecture instead. Check the contents of
<span class="style2">arch</span> directory to see what architectures are 
available. The architecture and related parameters is chosen when configuring 
the kernel using menuconfig. We will look at that tool later without making any 
changes.</p>

<ul>

    <li>Add new call to syscall tables for x86 and x64 architectures at the end of each list. 
    Pay attention to using the correct system call number.</li>
    The number does not have be the same in case of 32- and 64-bit Kernel system 
    call table but the number in the <span class="style2">unistd.h</span> must 
    point to the number in the system call table that is used to build the 
    Kernel. As of version <span class="style5"><span class="style2">6.8.12</span></span> 
    that number is <span class="style15"><span class="auto-style2">462</span></span> 
    or more but less than 512. 
    In the case of 64-bit version that will be at the end of 64-bit function calls.
    In the case of 32-bit version that will be at the end of the file. 
    <ul>
        <li><span class="style2">find . -name syscall*.tbl</span>
            <ul>
                <li>and inspect location of files for different microprocessor architectures.
                    In this lab we will limit activity to your current architecture which is most likely
                    either Intel or AMD 64-bit. We will also look at the 32-bit architecture to provide
                    the experience how different files might be for various architectures.

            <li>Insert the following text after the lines that relate to the system call 
                preceding our addition as listed in the files edited above
                <ul>

        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The next step is to add the new call to the file with list of substitute 
        system calls in case your system call implementation is missing. However, do 
        not do that as we do want to see a build error in case you made a mistake 
        and your function call implementation is really missing.
        <ul>
            <li><span class="style2">gedit kernel/sys_ni.c &amp;</span>
                <ul>
                    <li>Just inspect the file</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Now let's record content of all created or modified files for the sake of the submission of this lab.
        <ul>
            <li><span class="style12">cat test_call/test_call.c</span></li>
            <li><span class="style12">cat test_call/Makefile</span></li>
            <li><span class="style12">cat Makefile</span></li>
            <li><span class="style12">cat Kbuild</span></li>
            <li><span class="style12">cat arch/x86/entry/syscalls/syscall_32.tbl</span></li>
            <li><span class="style12">cat arch/x86/entry/syscalls/syscall_64.tbl</span></li>
            <li><span class="style12">cat include/linux/syscalls.h</span></li>

            <li><span class="style12">cat .config</span></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Now we will complete building the kernel with the new system call in place.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Back in the terminal window. This is the longest step and it does not 
    require much attention. However, check on the building process every now and 
    then so that any errors are discovered early and are corrected. If you made 
    a mistake in your system call code it will during the make process. Correct 
    and restart make by repeating the command.</li>
    The date command is used only for the purpose to document how much time the 
    process takes on your computer.
    <ul>
        <li><span class="style2">pwd</span></li>
        <li><span class="style2">make bindeb-pkg LOCALVERSION<strong>=</strong><span class="style5"><strong>-your-lowercase-initials</strong></span></span></li>

        <li><span class="style6">Take a screenshot NR 1 of the console window</span></li> 
    </ul>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="style2"><span class="style5"><strong>-your-initials</strong></span></span>&rdquo; is the name for your new kernel build. 
Use your lowercase initials or your BUnetID to get credit for this lab. In 
general, the <strong>version name must start with a dash (-) and can contain only 
lowercase characters and digits</strong>. The make will fail at some point if your naming is not compatible. 
If that happens restart from "<span class="style2">make mrproper</span>".The 
edits you made will survive that reset except for the .config file.</p>
<p>After the last line, your kernel will start compiling. This may take a few hours depending on your computer.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Install the new kernel (at the terminal)

<h3>In case of Kernel Panic during boot time</h3>

<p>Do not panic! This affects only your version of Kernel. 
Reset the computer and choose the unmodified version of the kernel. 
If you see several versions on the menu, then choose the latest one that does not have your initials appended.</p>

<h3>Running Your Custom Kernel</h3>

<ul>
    <li class="style1">If you are running outside a virtual machine, e.g., dual 
        boot, make sure that secure boot option is disabled for the duration of 
        runnign the custm kernel as it is not digitally signed.</li>
	<li>Reboot your computer and select your custom configuration in grub menu at boot time.
        <ul>
            <li><span class="style2">sudo shutdown -r now</span></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The boot menu might show up for a few seconds. In case it does not then 
        you need to depress and hold SHIFT during the boot procedure after the BIOS hands in control to grub2.
        <ul>
        <li>Pressing SHIFT too long when running VMWare under Windows may initiate Windows Accessibility Tool. 
            Depressing it too late will result in booting to the most recent version 
            of the kernel instead of our modified version.</li>
        <li>grub2 remembers the previous boot kernel selection, and it boots again into the same kernel 
            unless menu is called again and the selection changed again.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Select advanced options, and then select your kernel version <span class="style2">
        linux-image-<span class="style5">6.NN.MM-your-initials</span></span></li>
    <li>After the system is up verify whether you booted into the right kernel version:
        <ul>
            <li><span class="style2">uname -r</span> </li>
            <li>Reboot again if not running your version of the kernel.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>To run your system call, you will need to write a short program. Make sure that you compile it while using your version of the kernel as you depend on your modified header files to do the call. </p>
<ul>
    <li>Verify that you are using the right kernel<ul>
        <li><span class="style12">date</span></li>
        <li><span class="style12">whoami</span></li>

        <li><span class="style2">cat /proc/kallsyms | grep test_call</span></li>
    </ul>
    <li>Create a new file in a directory under your account, say call the directory &ldquo;<span class="style2">test_call</span>&rdquo;.</li>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="style2">gedit test_call_run.c &amp;</span></li>
        <li>Enter the following text. Make sure that you use the right system call number for the version of your kernel (32-bit vs. 64-bit). 
        Please note that even if you installed 64-bit version of Ubuntu the new 
        custom kernel might be 32-bit because of the unchecked x64 bit option in <span class="style2">make menuconfig</span>

<h3>Cleanup - optional</h3>

<p>So now you wander whether now you need to live with your custom Kernel until the end of the course, or perhaps your hard drive life cycle? </p>

<ul>
    <li>Reboot into the current kernel version. </li>
    <li><span class="style2">uname -r</span> to verify the current kernel version. 
        In case you are still running the custom version reboot and rectify the situation.</li>
    <li><span class="style2">uname -a</span></li>
    <li><span class="style2">sudo dpkg -l 'linux-image-*'</span></li>
    <li><span class="style2">sudo dpkg -r linux-image-<span class="style5">6.NN-your-initials_xxx</span></span></li>
    <li><span class="style2">sudo dpkg -l 'linux-headers-*'</span></li>
    <li><span class="style2">sudo dpkg -r linux-headers-<span class="style5">6.NN-your-initials_xxx</span></span></li>
    <li><span class="style2">sudo rm /boot/*<span class="style5">6.NN-your-initials</span>*</span></li>
    <li><span class="style2">sudo /usr/sbin/update-grub</span></li>
    <li>Consider hunting down all of the past kernels except the most current one (two packages per kernel). Happy hunting!</li>
    <li>Remove the folder where you downloaded, unpacked, modified, and compiled 
        the kernel source file and all subfolders and their contents</li>
</ul>



<h2>Submission</h2>

<p>Use <span class="style2">tar</span> and then <span class="style2">gzip</span> 
or <span class="style2">bz2</span> to combine all script files required for the 
lab submission into one file. A &quot;convenience fee&quot; may be charged for use of 
other kinds of compression.</p>

<p>Drop the compressed file with <span class="style7">the information collected during the 
exercise as instructed</span> and <span class="style6">the two captured images</span> 
in the corresponding assignment drop box on Canvas. 
The installed Ubuntu disks or the virtual machine configurations will not be collected.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>



<h2>Criteria for Success</h2>

<p>This lab proof of work can be graded in three stages of success: 
<ul>
    <li>Your name, initials or user ID needs to be inserted as requested in order
        to have any credit awarded for the work.</li>
    <li>A partial credit is awarded if significant effort has been made as it can be 
        verified by inspecting the recorded script or series of scripts but no postive results 
        listed below have been achieved.</li>
    <li>75% of credit is awarded if the kernel with the customized tag was compiled successfull 
        as show by the attached SCREENSHOT 1 that shows the debian packages listed by ls -l .. command
        and by uname -a command captured by SCREENSHOT 2.</li>
    <li>Full credit os awarded if the lab has been completed as shown by SCREENSHOT 2 
        that captured the <span class="s_command">uname -a</span> command showing 
        that you booted into your custom kernel (your name or initils shown) 
        and that the new system call was added correctly as verified 
        by the <span class="s_command">ltrace</span> and/or <span class="s_command">strace</span> 
        command results captured in the screenshot.</li>
    <li>Additional modest extra credit of up to 10% is awarded if the fully successful lab 
        is submitted early ahead of the deadline as defined when majority of course participants 
        start submitting successfully completed lab assignments.</li>
</ul>
