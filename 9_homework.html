<ul>
</ul>


<h2>🔍 Prepare for the lab</h2> 
 
<p>Answer these questions while doing this lab &ndash; they will help you understand the procedure and better prepare for the tests.</p>
<ul> 
    <li>Where are the cron tables located. (Hint: there is one main table and additional ones for each user.)</li> 
    <li>What does <span class="s_command">crontab</span> do? Why -e?</li>
    <li>What are possible ways to find a program's process id?</li> 
    <li>What do the <span class="s_command">``</span> do in a shell command? (note: backquotes)</li>
    <li>What do the <span class="s_command">$(insert_command_here)</span> do in a shell command?</li> 
    <li>Why can't we just find the process id for a program once and use that every time it is run?</li> 
    <li>What does <span class="s_command">which</span> do?</li>
    <li>What does <span class="s_command">awk</span> do?</li>
    <li>What does <span class="s_command">head</span> do?</li>
    <li>What does <span class="s_command">tail</span> do?</li>
    <li>What does <span class="s_command">cut</span> do?</li>
    <li>Can <span class="s_command">cut</span> be used instead of <span class="s_command">awk</span>? 
        Would it be simpler to use it? If so, then what would be command line?
    </li>
    <li>What does <span class="s_command">grep</span> do?</li>
    <li>What is the difference in output when <span class="s_command">grep</span> is used as 
        <span class="s_command">grep <em>expression</em></span> and as <span class="s_command">grep -o <em>expression</em></span>?
    </li>
    <li>Why sometimes one needs to use ' 's or &quot; &quot;s around a command line argument (like in case of awk in this lab)?
        <br>What is the difference between use of single quote and double quote?
    </li>
    <li>What does <span class="s_command">kill</span> program do instead of terminating a process when used in its default settings?</li>
    <li>Where are the programs <span class="s_command">kill</span>, <span class="s_command">ps</span>, 
        <span class="s_command">grep</span>, and<span class="s_command"> awk</span> located on Ubuntu/Debian Linux?
    </li>
    <li>Where are the programs <span class="s_command">kill</span>, <span class="s_command">ps</span>, 
        <span class="s_command">grep</span>, and<span class="s_command"> awk</span> located on uCLinux? 
        Are they separate programs, or work through BusyBox?
    </li> 
    <li>Can we eliminate <span class="s_command">grep</span> by adding an option or another parameter to <span class="s_command">awk</span>? How?</li>
    <li>What is the difference between using <span class="s_command">crontab -e</span> and <span class="s_command">sudo crontab -e</span> ?</li>
    <li>Where are the actual cron tables stored? Is there one global configuration file, or one per each user? Is it in ASCII format, or binary? <br>
        Hint: After doing the work check <span class="s_command">/var/spool/</span> and subfolders, 
        <span class="s_command">/etc/cron.d/</span> folder family <span class="s_command">/etc/cron.*/</span>, 
        and file <span class="s_command">/etc/crontab</span>.
    </li>
    <li>Explore how to set up the program to run on a particular schedule beyond examples provided in this instruction. 
        For example: how to run program at 2am every Saturday morning?
    </li>
    <li>In <span class="s_command">crontab</span>, why some commands do need full path while others do not?</li>
    <li>In the following lab a number is used for <span class="s_command"><span class="s_cmd_choice">YOURSIGNAL</span></span>. 
        Is it a good or bad idea to use signal number 9? Why? 
        Are there any (other) numbers that could make this lab not work well?
    </li>
</ul> 
 
<h2>🖥️ Activity 1 (10 pts.)</h2>

<h3>Use Cron table to Control a Program on Linux</h3>

<ul> 
    <li><strong><span class="s_tograde">Record this procedure using script for the assignment submission.</span>
        <br /><span class="s_cmd_4grade">script hw9_1.txt</span></strong></li> 
    <li>Download the source code of the program <a href="9_signal_reporter.c.HTML" class="s_command">signal_reporter.c</a> that you are going to be using.</li> 
    <li>Edit <span class="s_command">signal_reporter.c</span>, 
        attempt to read and understand how the program works. 
        You should enter <span class="s_command">man kill</span> and read about the functionality of kill 
        and the different signals available to you.</li>
        <ol> 
            <li> Pick a signal number (an integer) and replace the sequence of characters 
                <span class="s_command"><span class="s_cmd_choice">YOURSIGNAL</span></span>
            </li>
            <li>Change the signal handler function's name to reflect your signal choice.</li>
            <li>Change the function pointer to reflect your functions name</li>
            <li>Change the signal handled by your function in the sigaction() call.</li>
            <li>Customize the information printed by the program by inserting your name 
                instead of <span class="s_command"><span class="s_cmd_choice">&lt;insert_your_name_here&gt;</span></span>.
            </li>
        </ol> 

    <li>Compile the C file using g++ or your favorite C or C++ compiler and name the output file 
        <span class="s_command">signal_reporter</span></li>
    <li>Open a second terminal window if you did not have two open before.</li> 
    <li>Run the program in the first terminal window</li>
    <li>In the second terminal window run subsequently the commands and observe their output:
        <ul>
            <li><span class="s_command">ps -ef</span></li>
            <li><span class="s_command">ps -ef | grep signal_reporter</span></li>
            <li><span class="s_command">ps -ef | grep signal_reporter | awk &#39;{ print $2}&#39;</span></li>
            <li> <span class="s_command">ps -ef | grep signal_reporter | awk &#39;{ print $2}&#39; | head -n 1</span></li>
            <li><span class="s_command">echo &quot;ps -ef | grep signal_reporter | awk &#39;{ print $2}&#39; | head -n 1&quot;</span></li>
            <li><span class="s_command">echo $(ps -ef | grep signal_reporter | awk &#39;{ print $2}&#39; | head -n 1)</span></li>
            <li><span class="s_command">echo `ps -ef | grep signal_reporter | awk &#39;{ print $2}&#39; | head -n 1`</span></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>In the second terminal window enter <span class="s_command">kill -<span class="s_cmd_choice">YOURSIGNAL</span> 
        `ps -ae | grep signal_reporter | awk '{ print $1}' 
        | head -n 1`</span> Note: Replace <span class="s_cmd_choice">YOURSIGNAL</span> 
        with the signal number you chose earlier.
        <ul>
            <li>Observe and explain the use <span class="s_command">$1</span> or
                <span class="s_command">$2</span> depending on the ps options
                <span class="s_command">ps -ae</span> or <span class="s_command">ps -ef</span>.
            </li>
            <li>Observe and explain the need or lack of need for <span class="s_command">head -n 1</span>.</li>
            <li>Be prepared to explain the observations above.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>In the first terminal window that was running the program you should see it state that it received a user signal.</li>
    <li>If that succeeded you can now use cron to automate the signal passing to the program.
    <li>To edit the cron table enter <span class="s_command">crontab -e</span> to enter the cron table editor. 
        Note that on some systems you must be a root to do so. 
        Otherwise, root and every user have their own cron table. 
        Programs added by root run as root, added by a user without <span class="s_command">sudo</span> run as that user.
        <br><strong>Watch out!</strong> The default editor might be set as <span class="s_command">vi</span> 
        or <span class="s_command">vim</span>. Check how to use it by running man vi. <strong>(ESC :wq ENTER)</strong>.
    </li> 
    <li>Cron table entries are constructed as follows: 
        minute (0-59), hour (0-23, 0 = midnight), day (1-31), month (1-12), weekday (0-6, 0 = Sunday), command
        <br>Commands located in <span class="s_command">/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin</span> 
        does not need to be specified with a full path. For example,   
        <ul>
            <li>Check references for exact syntax, for example,
                <a href="https://debian-handbook.info/browse/stable/" target="_blank">The Debian Administrator's Handbook</a>.
            </li>
            <li>to run the command every 2 hours the table would look like this:
                <br><span class="s_command">0 */2 * * * /full/path/command_followed_by_its_options... /running_directory</span>
            </li>
            <li>to run the command at 12am and 12pm the table would look like this:
                <br><span class="s_command">0 0,12 * * * /full/path/command_followed_by_its_options... /running_directory</span>
            </li>
            <li>to run the command at 2am on the first five days of each month the table would look like this:
                <br><span class="s_command">0 2 1-5 * * /full/path/command_followed_by_its_options... /running_directory</span>
            </li>
            <li>Exercise: try to explain the following schedule:
                <br><span class="s_command">0 2-6/2 1-2,5,10 * * /full/path/command_followed_by_its_options... /running_directory</span>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Set  the signal to be sent to the program every two minutes and create a new entry in the cron table 
        that will send the signal to your program using kill. 
        Use the kill command we used earlier to test the functionality of the program. 
        Note that the cron table may utilize a different PATH variable 
        and thus at least some programs called must include their path so you cannot just call <span class="s_command">kill</span>.
    <li>Save and exit. The terminal should report <span class="s_command">crontab: installing new crontab</span></li>
    <li>If the <span class="s_command">signal_reporter</span> program is not currently running in one of the terminal windows 
        start it now and watch its output. When the cron table task occurs you should see the program detecting it 
        and it should also report the interval that you set in the <span class="s_command">crontab</span> editor.</li>
    <li>wait at least five to seven minutes to record at least two or three about 120-second-long intervals</li>
    <li>Stop the program with Ctrl+C</li>
    <li><strong><span class="s_tograde">take the screenshot of the entire screen that shows 
        the console with signal_reporter showing auto-generated received signals.</span></strong></li>
    <li><strong><span class="s_tograde">Exit script</span>.</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2>🖥️ Activity 2 (10 pts.)</h2>

<h3>Use Cron table to Control a Program on Microcontroller Linux</h3>

<ul>
    <li><strong><span class="s_tograde">Record this procedure using script for the assignment submission.</span>
        <br><span class="s_cmd_4grade">script hw9_2.txt</span></strong>
    </li>
    <li>Start <span class="s_command">putty</span> or <span class="s_command">ssh</span>.</li>
    <li>Login as root.</li>
    <li><span class="s_tograde">Type </span><span class="s_cmd_4grade">uname -a</span></li>
    <li>Verify if <span class="s_command">crond</span> is running. Starting 2024 crond may be already setup for your microcontroller board.
        <ul>
            <li><span class="s_command">ps -ef | grep cron</span></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Inspect the directory <span class="s_command">/etc/cron/crontabs</span> by typing <span class="s_command">ls -l /etc/cron/crontabs</span>
        <br>If the folder does not exist then proceed with the 2023 and earlier version of this lab as follows:
        <ul>
            <li>Inspect the directory <span class="s_command">/var</span> by typing <span class="s_command">ls -l /var</span>
                <br>Observe that the directory <span class="s_command">spool</span> is a symbolic link to
                <span class="s_command">/tmp</span> which is stored in ram disk. Any changes will disappear after reboot.
            </li>
            <li>Create missing folders. In the unlikely case folders already existed 
                nothing will get erased and errors will be displayed either:
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="s_command">mkdir -p /var/spool/cron/atjobs</span></li>
                    <li><span class="s_command">mkdir -p /var/spool/cron/atspool</span></li>
                    <li><span class="s_command">mkdir -p /var/spool/cron/crontabs</span></li>
                    <li><span class="s_command">chmod -R a+rx /var/spool/cron</span></li>
                    <li><span class="s_command">sync</span></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Start <span class="s_command">crond</span></li>
            <li>Verify if <span class="s_command">crond</span> is running. If not, then try to figure out why not and rectify the problem.
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="s_command">ps -ef | grep cron</span></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Repeat the same process as in the first part of this lab by compiling the program for ucLinux 
        and setting it up on the embedded system board in the lab. </li>
    <li>Check if you need to change the location or any options on <span class="s_command">crontab</span>,
        <span class="s_command"> kill</span>, <span class="s_command">ps</span>, 
        <span class="s_command"> grep</span>, <span class="s_command">awk</span>, or <span class="s_command">cut</span>.
    </li>
    <li><span class="s_tograde">Type </span><span class="s_cmd_4grade">uname -a</span></li>
    <li>wait at least five to seven minutes to record at least two or three about 120-second-long intervals</li>
    <li>Stop the program with Ctrl+C</li>
    <li><strong><span class="s_tograde">take the screenshot of the entire screen that shows 
        the console with signal_reporter showing auto-generated received signals.</span></strong></li>
    <li><strong><span class="s_tograde">Exit script</span>.</strong></li>
</ul>



<h2>📤 Submission</h2> 

<p>For each exercise, drop the captured screen image that shows the output produced by 
the signal receiver program reporting receving the signal at least several times 
in the corresponding assignment drop box on Canvas. In case of the second part of
the lab also capture running <span class="s_cmd_4grade">uname -a</span> 
in the same screenshot. Resize the terminal as necessary.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p> 



<h2>🎯 Criteria for Success</h2>

<p>The success in this lab is measured by the following outcomes:
<ul>
    <li><span class="s_command">signalreporter</span> program must print student's name, initials, or BUnetID (user name not ID number)
        in order to be considered for grading.</li>
    <li>Correct setup of the process number filter is the first of two steps of a success lab.
        This can de demonstrated by runnign the <span class="s_command">signalreporter</span> in one 
        terminal window while running the correctly setup cascade of piped commands in a second terminal.</li>
    <li>If the step above is successfull proceed with scheduling it using CRON service. 
        The success can de demonstrated by running <span class="s_command">signalreporter</span> for at least six
        or seven minutes and capturing reported intervals between receiving the signal to be consistently reported
        to be as desired when setting up schedule in the CRON service .</li>
    <li>Persistence of the CRON table scheduling service is expected but the current lab procedure is not cunductive to grading that.</li>
    <li>The Buildroot portion of the lab contains cross-compilation procedure that has been already graded by Lab 7.</li>
</ul>
