<h1>ECE 472/572 Assignment 3</h1>


<h2>💡 Purpose</h2>

<p>This course follows two trails, the theory of modern operating systems with emphasis on Unix/Linux, 
and hands-on laboratory experience with emphasis on setting up environements that facilitate development 
of software for electronic control modules using embedded Linux Buildroot style. 
This assignment is probably the only assignment that deviates from this hands-on laboratory theme 
and follows more of what assignemnts of a similar course in Computer Science Department has.
The reason for this is that using pipes for communicaiton is probably the only software programming 
feature that is unlikely to be experienced in advanced programming courses that cover multithreading 
and/or network socket programming.</p>

<h2>🔍 Prepare for the lab</h2>

<p>Answer these questions while doing this lab &ndash; they will help you understand the procedure and better prepare for the tests.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Check how to use and exercise the following 
        commands. You may be asked about them during the coming test. In some 
        cases the command is listed several times with additional listings 
        indicating certain useful options that could be used with a particular 
        command:
    <ul>
      <li>cd</li>
      <li>bz2</li>
      <li>chmod</li>
      <li>gzip</li>
      <li>gunzip</li>
      <li>ls -F</li>
      <li>ls -alF</li>
      <li>man</li>
      <li>mkdir</li>
      <li>pwd</li>
      <li>rm</li>
      <li>rm -rf</li>
      <li>rmdir</li>
      <li>tar</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>For tar please look up also what the following commands would do, and why "f" is used always as the last option in these examples. What happens when &quot;z&quot; is replaced with &quot;j&quot;?
    <ul>
      <li>tar -cvf file.tar folder</li>
      <li>tar -cf file.tar folder</li>
      <li>tar -czf file.tgz folder</li>
      <li>tar -xzf file.tar</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>How to create a named pipe? It is done by some of your programs but it can be done from a terminal instead. </li>
  <li>How to include an additional standard library that is not included by default when <strong>linking</strong> a program using gcc?</li>
</ul>


<h2>🖥️ Activity (20 pts.)</h2>

<p>Write a set of three programs called <strong>ONE.c</strong>, <strong>TWO.c</strong> 
and <strong>THREE.c
</strong>that would use the total of two named pipes to communicate ONE to TWO 
and TWO to THREE. Run them simultanously in three terminals. The first program 
shall ask user to enter text, one line at a time and send it through a pipe to 
the program TWO. The program TWO shall receive the text from the program ONE and 
immediately resend it to the program THREE without displaying it on the screen. 
The program THREE shall receive the the text from the program TWO and 
Program TWO shall print an asterisk each time a message is passed from one pipe to another.
immediately display it to the console screen. The program ONE is ready to exit 
when a user enters an empty line. The program ONE shall send that empty line to 
program TWO to indicate that it shall exit as well but only after the message is 
resent to program THREE so that it can exit as well.</p>

<h3>📤 Proof of Work for Grading</h3>

<p>In order to test your work: open terminal windows for each compiled program. 
Rearrange the windows so that you could see each of them. Go to the same folder in each of the terminals. 
Compile the programs; you may do all of them from one of the terminals. 
Run your programs, one in each terminal. Type lines from keyboard into the first program. 
<strong>One of the lines must contain your name in order for the work to recevie any credit.</strong> 
Observe the same text appearing in the last program. 
Capture the computer screen of your programs running and save as screen.png file into the same folder. </p>

<p>Pack your folder with program source files and compiled binary files using 
tar and then gzip. Remember to execute tar from outside of that folder! 
Consider how to perform both tar and gzip on one compound command line. 
Consider the right file extension to indicate the correct file type to the grader.</p>


<h2>Alternative 30 pts. version with a 10 pts. extra credit</h2>

<p>Consider the pair of programs for Posix style pipes that is posted in the 
programming examples section: <code>Named Pipes in Posix - sender</code> and 
<code>Named Pipes in Posix - receiver</code>, and also a pair of programs for 
Posix style shared memory: <code>Named Shared memory server in Posix</code> and 
<code>Named Shared memory client in Posix</code>.</p>

<p>Do the following experiment in a dedicated folder created inside your Ubuntu 
Linux account. Regardless from the version you choose you are still responsible 
for studying both communication by pipes and by shared memory in order to 
prepare for the upcoming quiz or test.</p>

<h3>Hints for the extra credit version</h3>

<p>Write a pair of programs called <strong>ONE.c</strong> and <strong>TWO.c
</strong>that would use both technologies, one area of shared 
    memory and two named pipes to communicate between each other in the way 
described below. </p>
<ul>
    <li>Program ONE:<ul>
        <li>Create two named pipes in the current directory with 
    names &quot;one-two&quot; and &quot;two-one&quot; in the current folder. The pipes shall be read write 
    accessible only to the current user. Ignore potential &quot;pipe already created&quot; 
        errors.</li>
        <li>Open the two named pipes.<ul>
            <li>The pipe #1 (&quot;one-two&quot;) shall be open for writing.</li>
            <li>The pipe #2 (&quot;two-one&quot;) shall be open for reading.</li>
            <li>Important: open in that order!</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Create shared memory block of 512 bytes. The block shall be read write accessible only to the current user.</li>
        <li>Send the shared memory ID to the second program by writing to pipe #1 and then read back one character from pipe #2.
        <ul>
            <li>Use sprintf to convert integer ID to char array. Use constant buffer of the hard coded size.
            <ul>
                <li>Important! Send the entire fixed size buffer, do not use 
                strlen(...). Hard code the same number in the second&nbsp; 
                program.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>&nbsp;Optionally you can hard code the shared memory ID in the second program as well instead of doing this data transfer.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Proceed with the loop: <strong>(The program shall contain only one loop!)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <ul>
            <li>Ask the user to enter some text from a console up to 511 bytes long. </li>
            <li>Store the text in shared memory.
            <ul>
                <li>Either read directly to the shared memory using 
                fgets(shmem_pointer, 512,stdin);</li>
                <li>or copy using strcpy(shmem_pointer, buffer) or use sprintf(shmem_pointer, &quot;%s&quot;, buffer);</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Check the size of the string entered by the user, for example 
            strlen(buffer);</li>
            <li>Write one character to pipe #1to indicate that the shared memory 
            contains valid data ready to be received, <br>or that the programs 
            need to end their work. For example, use '*' in the first case, and 
            'x' ion the latter case.
            <ul>
                <li>For example code like: char ch='*'; write(#1, &amp;ch, 1);</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Read one character from pipe #2 to and that way wait until the second program retrieves data from shared memory.
            <ul>
                <li>For example code like: char ch'; read(#2, &amp;ch, 1);</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>If the original buffer was empty or the 'x' character was 
            received then exit the loop</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Close both pipes.</li>
        <li>Unlink file names for both pipes, ignore any potential errors.</li>
        <li>Clean&nbsp; up shared memory.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Program TWO:<ul>
        <li>Create two named pipes in the current directory with 
    names &quot;one-two&quot; and &quot;two-one&quot; in the current folder. The pipes shall be read write 
    accessible only to the current user. Ignore potential &quot;pipe already created&quot; 
        errors.</li>
        <li>Open the two named pipes.<ul>
            <li>The pipe #1 (&quot;one-two&quot;) shall be open for reading.</li>
            <li>The pipe #2 (&quot;two-one&quot;) shall be open for writing.</li>
            <li><strong>Important: open in that order, or the two programs will stall!</strong></li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Receive the shared memory ID to the second program by reading from 
        pipe #1 and then writing back one character to pipe #2.
        <ul>
            <li>Use constant buffer of the hard coded size., Use sscanf to convert contents of the buffer to integer ID.
            <ul>
                <li>Important! request reading the same number of characters that the first program sent!</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>&nbsp;Optionally you can hard code the shared memory ID in the second program as well instead of doing this data transfer.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Create shared memory block of 512 bytes. The block shall be read write accessible only to the current user.</li>
        <li>Proceed with the loop: <strong>(The program shall contain only one loop!)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <ul>
            <li>Read one character from pipe #1.
            <ul>
                <li>For example code like: char ch'; read(#2, &amp;ch, 1);</li>
                <li>if the character indicates end of transmission then send the 
                same character back and exit the loop;</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Retrieve the text from shared memory.<ul>
                <li>Either use a loop to copy the text byte by byte and terminate using '\0'</li>
                <li>use puts(shmem_pointer) or use fprintf(stdout, &quot;%s&quot;, shmem_pointer);</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Write one character to pipe #2 to indicate that the shared memory 
            data has been red and can be replaced with new data.
            <ul>
                <li>For example code like: write(#1, &amp;ch, 1);</li>
            </ul>

<h2>📤 Submission</h2>

<p>Drop off the produced .TGZ file in the corresponding assignment drop box on Canvas.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>



<h2>🎯 Criteria for Success</h2>

<p>A successfully completed lab results in the submission of source code of the requested three programs
and a screen captures that shows three consoles with the three requested programs running. The screenshot
shall show the user typing a few lines of text into the first console that appears printed by the program 
in the third console. The instructor inspects the soruce code to verify that the first program communicates
only with the second program and that the third program also communicates only th the second program. 
Thus the second program serves as an intermediary between the two others and does not read or print anything 
to its cosole. The success is completed by demonstrating correct use of tar and gzip to create a single file 
archive that is submitted for grading. In case of the extra credit the functionality of the two extra credit 
programsis demonstrated instead. Partial credit is awarded for partial functinality of the regular
assingnment. No partial credit is awarded for incomplete extra credit version of the assignment.</p>
